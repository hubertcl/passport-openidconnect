# Passport-OpenID Connect Extra

[Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport) strategy for authenticating
with [OpenID Connect](http://openid.net/connect/).

This module lets you authenticate using OpenID Connect in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, OpenID Connect authentication can be
easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that
supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware,
including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).

This module has been forked by Claire Hubert to allow additional, non-standard parameters such as realm and usesso.
